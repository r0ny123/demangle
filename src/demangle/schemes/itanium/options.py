"""Caller-selectable policy for Itanium output.

Some questions a demangler faces have no single right answer -- the two reference
implementations answer them differently, and both are correct. Those belong here, as
explicit options with a documented default, rather than being decided silently in the
parser.

Frozen, so an options object can be shared between threads and used as a cache key.
