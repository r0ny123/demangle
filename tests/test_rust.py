"""Rust mangled names: the rules that decide what is *refused*.

The spellings are pinned by the corpora in `test_conformance.py`; what is pinned here is
the boundary, which no corpus of real symbols exercises because a compiler does not emit
malformed names. Every expectation below was measured against `rustc-demangle` 0.1.28
itself -- the crate `rustfilt` is built from -- driven one whole line at a time, rather
than against `rustfilt`, whose command line scans a line for something that looks like a
symbol and so answers a different question.

    one character whose value has bit 7 clear, so it passed and its identifier was

    carries a non-ASCII character literally -- v0 spells one in punycode and the legacy
