"""Replay the checked-in corpora.

Pass counts are pinned as exact numbers rather than floors. A floor lets a fix that
silently breaks something else slip through as long as the net stays positive; an exact
number means every change in either direction has to be an explicit edit to this file,
with a reason in the commit that makes it.

These tests need neither a compiler nor the reference demanglers: the expected output is
recorded in the corpus files. Regenerate them with tools/generate_corpus.py.
