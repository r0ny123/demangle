# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Rust `parse()` returns a tree.** A Rust symbol was a single `raw` node, so `walk()`
  and `find()` saw nothing below the root. It now comes back as a `symbol` holding a
  `path` of `name` components, with `impl`, `namespace`, `template`, `type` and
  `literal` nodes for what a path carries. An impl names its self-type and its trait as
  fields, a closure carries its disambiguator, and the legacy scheme's hash is kept
  although it is still not spelled.

  The v0 printer now emits into a *sink* rather than concatenating a string: `TextSink`
  joins the fragments, `TreeSink` remembers where each production began and ended. There
  is one traversal, so a tree renders to exactly what `demangle()` returns by
  construction rather than by agreement. Verified over all 5,738 Rust names in the
  corpora: text byte-identical to before the change, every tree spelling identical to
  its text, and no name left as a bare leaf.

### Changed

- `demangle()` output is unchanged for every symbol. This was checked against a snapshot
  taken before the work started, not asserted.

## [0.1.0] -- initial release

First extraction of the demanglers developed inside
[SMDA](https://github.com/danielplohmann/smda) into a standalone library, rebuilt around
a scheme-agnostic core.

### Added

- **Itanium C++ ABI** demangler, written from the specification. Parses to a structured
  tree.
- **MSVC** decorated-name demangler, also structured, with its own node kinds and
  renderer because its declarator spelling genuinely differs from the C-family one.
- **Rust** legacy (`_ZN`) and v0 (`_R`) demangling, including punycode identifiers and
  v0 structural const arguments.
- **Symbol-table decorations** — ELF version suffixes and compiler clone suffixes —
  handled as structure rather than as each grammar's problem.

### Conformance

Every checked-in corpus is exact against its reference, and so are whole symbol tables
read from shipped binaries — about 112,000 real symbols:

| Source | Reference | Exact |
|---|---|---|
| `libLLVM.so.18.1` | `llvm-cxxfilt` 18.1.3 | 44,186 / 44,186 |
| `libclang-cpp.so` + Polly + LTO | `llvm-cxxfilt` 18.1.3 | 41,140 / 41,140 |
| Rust toolchain | `rustc-demangle` 0.1.28 | 20,697 / 20,697 |
| `libstdc++.so.6` | `llvm-cxxfilt` 18.1.3 | 5,913 / 5,913 |
| Rust, both schemes | `rustc-demangle` 0.1.28 | 5,316 / 5,316 |
| MSVC (LLVM's own corpus) | `llvm-undname` 18.1.3 | 609 / 609 |
| Purpose-built C++ | `llvm-cxxfilt` 18.1.3 | 278 / 278 |

The three GNU-style shortfalls are disagreements between the two references about
substitution table contents, pinned by name.
- A **builder protocol** so one parser serves both a fast text path and a structured AST
  path without a second implementation to keep in sync.
- **Plugin registry** with `demangle.languages` entry-point discovery, so a separate
  distribution can add a scheme without patching this one.
- **Output styles** (`llvm`, `gnu`) for the places where the reference implementations
  legitimately disagree.
- `demangle` command-line tool.
- Conformance, property-based, fuzz, robustness and architecture-boundary test suites;
  reproducible benchmarks with a regression gate that also fails when a benchmark gets
  faster by doing less work.
